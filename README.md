# WhatsApp-Chat-Analysis
Every message you send on WhatsApp is a form of data. 
In this project, I have analyzed this data, and displayed it in a visually understandable manner.<br>
You can get to know who spends the most on a WhatsApp group,
what time is the group most active, most used emoji, etc.
You can also get details with respect to a specific user.

For using this, make sure the time is in 24hr format, and go to your WhatsApp and export data of any group or personal chat. <br>
